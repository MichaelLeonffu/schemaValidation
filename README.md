# schemaValidation




VALIDATING JSON SCHEMASSSSSS;

basically, define a schema in a really ez to read and ez to write light weight way (many defaults)


also add a bunch of scripts which can export the schema into many ways or import even;


some goals:
	* allow functions to have objects as their input which they can be run though validator
	* allow several ways of outputing and expressing information i.e return an object of what data was wrong and why
		* sciprts that would place schmas in correct locations in projects and could also gather and produce a nice schema looking deliverable
	* unit testing schemas
	* varible toleratance for schemas? (if certain fields are validated wrong then a degree of tolerance is broken)
	* nested schemas
	* rich schemas; comments and other information i.e examples and explaination to data
	* dynamic schemas; where schemas can be controled via data (mutable schemas)
	* schema to string and viseversa (maybe using json)
